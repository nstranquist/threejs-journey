# Three.js Journey Project

This repository contains the work and projects I've completed in parallel to the three.js journey course online that I am taking.

I am not adding the code from that directly.

Instead, I am doing my own projects for each section of the course.

### Objective

My goal for this course is to understand WebGL and three.js better from a lower level, so that I am able to more effectively leverage react three fiber to build more complex, immersive 3d experiences in my web applications.
